        While the physiological adaptations that occur following endurance training in previously sedentary and recreationally active 
        individuals are relatively well understood, the adaptations to training in already highly trained endurance athletes remain unclear. 
        While significant improvements in endurance performance and corresponding physiological markers are evident following submaximal 
        endurance training in sedentary and recreationally active groups, an additional increase in submaximal training (i.e. volume) in 
        highly trained individuals does not appear to further enhance either endurance performance or associated physiological variables 
        [e.g. peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak), oxidative enzyme activity]. It seems that, for athletes who are already trained, improvements 
        in endurance performance can be achieved only through high-intensity interval training (HIT). The limited research which has examined 
        changes in muscle enzyme activity in highly trained athletes, following HIT, has revealed no change in oxidative or glycolytic enzyme
        activity, despite significant improvements in endurance performance (p < 0.05). Instead, an increase in skeletal muscle buffering 
        capacity may be one mechanism responsible for an improvement in endurance performance. Changes in plasma volume, stroke volume, as 
        well as muscle cation pumps, myoglobin, capillary density and fibre type characteristics have yet to be investigated in response to 
        HIT with the highly trained athlete. Information relating to HIT programme optimisation in endurance athletes is also very sparse. 
        Preliminary work using the velocity at whichV̇O2max is achieved (Vmax) as the interval intensity, and fractions (50 to 75%) of the 
        time to exhaustion at Vmax (Tmax) as the interval duration has been successful in eliciting improvements in performance in long-distance 
        runners. However, Vmax and Tmax have not been used with cyclists. Instead, HIT programme optimisation research in cyclists has 
        revealed that repeated supramaximal sprinting may be equally effective as more traditional HIT programmes for eliciting improvements 
        in endurance performance. Further examination of the biochemical and physiological adaptations which accompany different HIT programmes, 
        as well as investigation into the optimal HIT programme for eliciting performance enhancements in highly trained athletes is required.

        Compared with the volume of research that describes the physiological adaptations to endurance-exercise training in sedentary and 
        recreationally trained individuals, relatively little work has examined the physiological and performance responses of already highly 
        trained athletes to a modified training programme. In part, this may be because of the difficulty of persuading highly trained athletes 
        to alter their training programmes to accommodate the interests of exercise scientists.[1] Consequently, recommendations made by 
        exercise scientists to coaches and athletes are largely based on training studies completed with sedentary and recreationally trained 
        individuals coupled with anecdotal hearsay of some successful coaches.[1,2] Highly trained athletes already have a high aerobic capacity, 
        lactate threshold (Tlac), and economy of motion.[3,4] Therefore, the physiological adaptations that generally account for improved 
        performance in sedentary or recreationally trained individuals[5,6] may not necessarily apply to the highly trained athlete.[7] 
        Indeed, in the highly trained athlete, an additional increase in submaximal exercise training (i.e. volume) does not appear to further 
        enhance either endurance performance or associated variables such as maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max), anaerobic threshold, economy of 
        motion and oxidative muscle enzymes.[8–10]

        In these individuals, it appears that further improvements in performance can only be achieved through high-intensity interval training 
        (HIT).[8] The only research to date that has examined the physiological responses of already highly trained athletes to HIT[7] indicates 
        no up-regulation of oxidative or glycolytic enzyme activity, despite significant improvements in 40km cycling time-trial performance and 
        peak power output (Ppeak) obtained during a progressive exercise test (p < 0.05). Skeletal muscle buffering capacity significantly 
        increased (p < 0.05), but the increase was not related to improvements in Ppeak and 40km time-trial performance. Thus, the mechanisms 
        responsible for improvements in performance following HIT in the already highly trained athlete remain unclear. This article will: (i) 
        briefly review the adaptations to endurance training known to occur in sedentary and recreationally active individuals; (ii) outline 
        some physiological mechanisms that may further enhance performance following HIT in the already highly trained athlete; and (iii) 
        consider the issue of HIT programme optimisation in the highly trained athlete.
