                <p>
                    WebNote is a javascript library that allows for note-taking directly on web pages. 
                    <br>
                    The various forms of note-taking include:
                    </p><ul>
                        <li>Highlight text in various colours</li>
                        <li>Cross out text</li>
                        <li>Add notes to text</li>
                        <li>Export the html of the page after note-taking</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>How to implement WebNote</h2>
                <p>Highlighting, striking out text, and adding a note are all performed by the same function in the WebNote library.</p>
                <p>To implement this functionality:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Figure out what text element you would like to add this functionality to on your webpage.</li>
                    <li>Get the id of the text element you want to add this functionality to by doing: 
                        <br>
                        <code>const textElement = document.getElementById("id_of_element");</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>In your javascript file, add an event listener for when the chosen element is clicked, and
                        <br> have the function from the WebNote
                        library called nextToHighlight be called:
                        <br>
                        <code>textElement.addEventListener('click', nextToHighlight);</code>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            </div>
          </div>

    While the physiological adaptations that occur following endurance training in <span class="tooltip" style="background-color: rgb(234, 234, 234);">previously se<span class="tooltiptext">hey</span></span>dentary and recreationally active 
    individuals are relatively well understood, the adaptations to training in already highly trained endurance athletes remain unclear. 
    While signif<span style="background-color: yellow;">icant improve</span>ments in endurance performance and corresponding physiological markers are evident following submaximal 
    endurance training in sedentary and recreationally active groups, an additional increase in submaximal training (i.e. volume) in 
    highly trained individuals does not appear to further enhance either endurance performance or associated physiological variables 
    [e.g. peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak), oxidative enzyme activity]. It seems that, for athletes who are already trained, improvements 
    in endurance performance can be achieved only through high-intensity interval training (HIT). The limited research which has examined 
    changes in muscle enzyme activity in highly trained athletes, following HIT, has revealed no change in oxidative or glycolytic enzyme
    activity, despite significant improvements in endurance performance (p &lt; 0.05). Instead, an increase in skeletal muscle buffering 
    capacity may be one mechanism responsible for an improvement in endurance performance. Changes in plasma volume, stroke volume, as 
    well as muscle cation pumps, myoglobin, capillary density and fibre type characteristics have yet to be investigated in response to 
    HIT with the highly trained athlete. Information relating to HIT programme optimisation in endurance athletes is also very sparse. 
    Preliminary work using the velocity at whichV̇O2max is achieved (Vmax) as the interval intensity, and fractions (50 to 75%) of the 
    time to exhaustion at Vmax (Tmax) as the interval duration has been successful in eliciting improvements in performance in long-distance 
    runners. However, Vmax and Tmax have not been used with cyclists. Instead, HIT programme optimisation research in cyclists has 
    revealed that repeated supramaximal sprinting may be equally effective as more traditional HIT programmes for eliciting improvements 
    in endurance performance. Further examination of the biochemical and physiological adaptations which accompany different HIT programmes, 
    as well as investigation into the optimal HIT programme for eliciting performance enhancements in highly trained athletes is required.

    <p id="abstract2">
    Compared with the volume of research that describes the physiological adaptations to endurance-exercise training in sedentary and 
    recreationally trained individuals, relatively little work has examined the physiological and performance responses of already highly 
    trained athletes to a modified training programme. In part, this may be because of the difficulty of persuading highly trained athletes 
    to alter their training programmes to accommodate the interests of exercise scientists.[1] Consequently, recommendations made by 
    exercise scientists to coaches and athletes are largely based on training studies completed with sedentary and recreationally trained 
    individuals coupled with anecdotal hearsay of some successful coaches.[1,2] Highly trained athletes already have a high aerobic capacity, 
    lactate threshold (Tlac), and economy of motion.[3,4] Therefore, the physiological adaptations that generally account for improved 
    performance in sedentary or recreationally trained individuals[5,6] may not necessarily apply to the highly trained athlete.[7] 
    Indeed, in the highly trained athlete, an additional increase in submaximal exercise training (i.e. volume) does not appear to further 
    enhance either endurance performance or associated variables such as maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max), anaerobic threshold, economy of 
    motion and oxidative muscle enzymes.[8–10]
    </p>
    <p id="abstract3">
    In these individuals, it appears that further improvements in performance can only be achieved through high-intensity interval training 
    (HIT).[8] The only research to date that has examined the physiological responses of already highly trained athletes to HIT[7] indicates 
    no up-regulation of oxidative or glycolytic enzyme activity, despite significant improvements in 40km cycling time-trial performance and 
    peak power output (Ppeak) obtained during a progressive exercise test (p &lt; 0.05). Skeletal muscle buffering capacity significantly 
    increased (p &lt; 0.05), but the increase was not related to improvements in Ppeak and 40km time-trial performance. Thus, the mechanisms 
    responsible for improvements in performance following HIT in the already highly trained athlete remain unclear. This article will: (i) 
    briefly review the adaptations to endurance training known to occur in sedentary and recreationally active individuals; (ii) outline 
    some physiological mechanisms that may further enhance performance following HIT in the already highly trained athlete; and (iii) 
    consider the issue of HIT programme optimisation in the highly trained athlete.
